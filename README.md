Carrer Experience:
I have twenty years of experience as a Software Engineer with expertise in object-oriented and functional programming languages.
My main experince in development of Algorithms, Core Infrastructure and Web Services. Following are the most relevant examples of my development work:

Microsoft:
Windows Server Security Configuration Wizard (SCW) Development. Developed a legacy Windows Server Security Configuration Wizard for allowing administrators to easily change a server's default security settings. SCW consists of the following main components: App Wizard Interface, Command-Line interface, Configuration/Rollback/Analysis Engines, and a Security Configuration Database. 
Developed and implemented the new AppLocker Security Platform in Windows 7. The security platform includes a UI Service, Deployment Windows Service (SvcHost), and interaction with kernel mode.Â Â 
Developed and implemented the Provisioning Service of Access Control Service of Office 365 and Windows Azure. This service has been integrated into the core of Windows Azure in which any provisioned user in the system becomes a client of the developed Provisioning Service. 
Innovated and implemented a Video Rendering Visualizer GUI with wxWidgets in C++. The Video Rendering Visualizer Tool includes Gui, Model, Controller with transactional updates, Configuration, TLogging, Logging, Tabular Data, Utilities, and Testing libraries. The Visualizer Tool parses TLogs and visualizes calls, compositors, and rendering pipeline(s) information, including runtime events in Event Viewer. 


Tableau:
Innovated and implemented a Health System, Health Runners, and performance counters framework from scratch, designed monitoring, and remediated the various Tableau Online/Public Services across multiple data centers in private/cloud environments. At production, the Health Service has generated 10,000 events per second.
Innovated and implemented a Multi-Instance Data Service for enabling the scaling of Tableau Online. The Service exposes APIs for managing user-data information and includes a Sync Engine for integrating user-data information from Tableauâ€™s Services.
Implemented a new Sync Client as a Windows Service in C++ for downloading task schedules and information from Tableau Online and performing automatic sync of the corresponding customerâ€™s data in the background.

Apptio:
Innovated and implemented from scratch a Tabular Data Transformation System for transforming Tabular Data based on Table Match rules. The core Table Match library supports a customized Rules Engine for supporting various data transformations and configurations of a dedicated compiler module for compiling the rules into an optimized code for transforming the data at runtime efficiently and precisely.
