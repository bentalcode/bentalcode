- Greetings, I am @bentalcode.
- I have a professional interest in Software Development.
- I am currently employed as a Software Engineer.
- For communication, please contact me via email at: bentaltagor@protonmail.com.

**Career Experience:** I possess twenty years of experience as a Software Engineer with specialized proficiency in both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. My primary expertise encompasses the development of algorithms, core infrastructure, and web services. The following are the most pertinent examples of my development work:

Microsoft:
Development of the Windows Server Security Configuration Wizard (SCW). Created a legacy SCW to facilitate administrators in modifying the default security configurations of Windows Server. The SCW encompasses several key components: Application Wizard Interface, Command-Line Interface, Configuration, Rollback, and Analysis Engines, as well as a Security Configuration Database.

Designed and implemented the AppLocker Security Platform for Windows 7. This security framework comprises a User Interface (UI) Service, a Deployment Service hosted by SvcHost, and integration with kernel mode operations.

Developed and integrated the Provisioning Service for the Access Control Service within Office 365 and Windows Azure. This service has been embedded into the core architecture of Windows Azure, ensuring that any user provisioned within the system is automatically designated as a client of the Provisioning Service.

Innovated and implemented a Video Rendering Visualizer Graphical User Interface (GUI) utilizing wxWidgets in C++. The Video Rendering Visualizer Tool incorporates GUI, Model, Controller with transactional updates, Configuration, TLogging, Logging, Tabular Data, Utilities, and Testing libraries. The tool processes TLogs to visualize function calls, compositors, and rendering pipeline information, including real-time events captured in the Event Viewer. 


Tableau:
Innovated and implemented a Health System, Health Runners, and performance counters framework from scratch, designed monitoring, and remediated the various Tableau Online/Public Services across multiple data centers in private/cloud environments. During production, the Health Service has achieved a throughput of 10,000 events per second.
Developed and deployed a Multi-Instance Data Service to facilitate the scalability of Tableau Online. This service provides APIs for managing user data and incorporates a Sync Engine for the integration of user data from Tableau's services. 
Engineered a Sync Client as a Windows Service using C++ to retrieve task schedules and relevant information from Tableau Online, enabling automatic synchronization of corresponding customer data in the background.

Apptio:
Developed and deployed a Tabular Data Transformation System, designed for the transformation of tabular data in accordance with Table Match rules. The foundational Table Match library is integrated with a customizable Rules Engine to facilitate diverse data transformations and configurations. Additionally, an advanced compiler module is included for converting the defined rules into optimized code, ensuring efficient and accurate data transformation at runtime.
